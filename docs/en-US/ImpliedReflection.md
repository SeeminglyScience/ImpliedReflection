# ImpliedReflection Module

## Description

Explore non-public types, properties, fields and methods as if they were public.

## ImpliedReflection Cmdlets

### [Enable-ImpliedReflection](Enable-ImpliedReflection.md)

The Enable-ImpliedReflection cmdlet injects hooks into the PowerShell engine to force non-public and unsupported members and types to function as though they were public. This operation is global to the process and is not reversible.
